This was a course project performed in groups of 6.

This code simulates a 5-stage single-core pipelined processor in C++
The 5 stages are:
  1) IF (Instruction Fetch)
  2) ID (Instruction Decode)
  3) ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
  4) MEM (Memory)
  5) WB (Writeback)
  
The instruction format is inspired from MIPS

The instructions are first parsed into machine code and then the pipeline starts fetching each instruction

All possible hazards are dealt with by adding waste instructions during the parsing stage in order to maintain correctness of result
